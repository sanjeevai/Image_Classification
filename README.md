## Project Overview

This is the second project of Machine Learning Engineer Advanced Nanodegree at Udacity.

## Files

This project contains 3 files:
* `image_classification.ipynb`: This is the main file where I did my main work
* Two helper files:
    1. `helper.py`
    2. `problem_unittests.py`

## Introduction

In this project, I'll classify images from the CIFAR-10 dataset. The dataset consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The dataset will need to be preprocessed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. I'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At then end, I'll see their predictions on the sample images.

## Getting the project files

The project files can be found from [Udacity's public GitHub repo](https://github.com/udacity/deep-learning), in the `image-classification` folder. You can download the files from there, but it's better to clone the repository to your computer.

This way you can stay up to date with any changes Udacity makes by pulling the changes to your local repository with git pull. Please note this project is written in Python 3.x.
