## Project: Create an Image Classifier

### Project Overview

This is the second project of ML Advanced Nanodegree from Udacity.

### Introduction

In this project, we will classify images from the CIFAR-10 data set. The data set consists of airplanes, dogs, cats, and other objects. The data set will need to be pre-processed, then train a convolutional neural network on all the samples. We'll normalize the images, one-hot encode the labels, build a convolutional layer, max pool layer, and fully connected layer. At the end, we'll see their predictions on the sample images.

### Files

This project contains 3 files:
* `image_classification.ipynb`: This is the file where I did my main work, i.e., building the network, and training it for classification.

* Two helper files:
    1. `helper.py`: It helps in performing some data loading and visualisation tasks.
    2. `problem_unittests.py`: It contains some test functions that check whether I have performed the TO-DOs correctly.

### Libraries

This project is written in Python 3.x. CNN was made using TensorFlow framework
